# Watchpost 2.0 demo script

Two cuts: a **30-second shot list** for the LinkedIn video, and a **2-minute walkthrough** for a live demo or a
longer recording. Both use the attack storyline (workstream C): **Admin → Attack storyline (synthetic) → Start
storyline** streams a six-stage synthetic intrusion (`recon` → `credential_attack` → `foothold` → `escalation` →
`lateral_cloud` → `exfiltration`) with baseline noise throughout, while the dashboard's **Storyline** tile shows the
current stage and progress. The speed selector next to the button sets the pace (1× is about two minutes).

Everything on screen is synthetic. Say so out loud in the walkthrough. The UI also says it (the **SYNTHETIC DATA**
chip, the "synthetic geo" label on the map, and the banner on every report).

## Setup (before recording)

1. Start from a fresh database, either the deployed demo (`deploy/README.md`) or locally:
   `SIEM_DB=/tmp/demo.db SIEM_VIEWER_PASSWORD='<12+ chars>' ./start.sh`.
2. Browser at **1280×800**, zoom 100 %, dark OS theme, bookmarks bar hidden, notifications off.
3. Sign in as **admin** in one window. Leave a second, private window signed in as **viewer** for the closing shot
   of the walkthrough.
4. Do a dry run at a high storyline speed to make sure alerts and an incident appear, then reset to a fresh database.
5. Screen recorder at 30 fps or more, cursor highlighting on. Record the storyline at a speed where the full run
   takes about 60 to 90 seconds, then speed up the middle in editing. The 30-second cut below is **edited** time.

## 30-second shot list

| # | Time | Shot | On screen | Caption / voice-over (optional) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0:00–0:03 | Dashboard, idle | Dark SOC dashboard: status strip, empty attack map, live stream ticking with baseline noise, clock running | "A SIEM I built from scratch." |
| 2 | 0:03–0:05 | Admin view | Cursor clicks **Start storyline** in the *Attack storyline (synthetic)* card | "Synthetic intrusion, streamed live." |
| 3 | 0:05–0:10 | Dashboard, recon | Storyline tile reads `recon`. On the Dominican Republic map, pulses fire where attacks enter from abroad and streak to HQ in Santo Domingo. Web scan and firewall deny events scroll by in the live stream. First alerts: `web_scanner`, `firewall_port_sweep` | "Recon: web scanning and a port sweep." |
| 4 | 0:10–0:14 | Dashboard, credential attack → foothold | `credential_attack`, then `foothold`. Red auth failures flood the stream; password spray and brute force alerts; the Critical counter ticks up | "Password spray, then a VPN foothold." |
| 5 | 0:14–0:18 | Dashboard, escalation → cloud → exfil | `escalation` → `lateral_cloud` → `exfiltration`. Alerts-over-time bars stack; ATT&CK heat matrix cells light up across tactics | "Root, a new cloud key, data out." |
| 6 | 0:18–0:23 | Incident board → incident detail | Click the critical incident: kill-chain stages across the top, **escalated: 3+ tactics** pill, techniques grouped by tactic, alert timeline | "Every alert chained into one incident, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK." |
| 7 | 0:23–0:27 | Report | Click **Report (PDF)**; the PDF opens with the SYNTHETIC DATA banner, summary, timeline, and techniques | "One-click incident report." |
| 8 | 0:27–0:30 | End card | Dashboard in the background; overlay: "Watchpost · Python standard library only · github.com/talalkashar/watchpost · read-only demo: `<DEMO_URL>`" | — |

Editing notes: keep shot 1 short. Cut straight from the button click to the first map pulse. Let the stage tile stay
readable for at least a second per stage. Burn in captions, since most LinkedIn viewers watch muted. Export 1080p
(1280×800 scaled, or pad to 16:9).

## 2-minute walkthrough

**0:00–0:15 · Frame it.** On the dashboard, as admin:
*"This is Watchpost, a SIEM I built from scratch in plain Python, no frameworks. Everything you'll see is synthetic
data: IPs from reserved documentation ranges, and map positions from a labeled synthetic table."* Point at the
**SYNTHETIC DATA** chip and the **SYNTHETIC GEO** label.

**0:15–0:25 · Start the attack.** **Admin → Attack storyline (synthetic) → Start storyline**, then back to **Dashboard**.
*"This replays a six-stage intrusion against a living system. Normal logins and traffic keep flowing the whole time,
so the attack has to stand out from noise."*

**0:25–0:55 · Watch detection happen.** Follow the **Storyline** tile through the stages.
- Recon: *"A web scanner probing `/.env` and `/wp-login.php`, and the firewall denying a port sweep. Two rules
  fire."*
- Credential attack and foothold: *"A password spray across ten accounts, brute force on one, then a successful VPN
  login from the same IP. Success after failures is critical."*
- Escalation, cloud, exfil: *"sudo to root on `web01`, a new admin user, a login to `db01`, a cloud access key created
  by a principal we've never seen, then a burst of data reads."*
Point at the live stream (color by severity), the alerts-over-time chart, and the ATT&CK heat matrix filling in.

**0:55–1:25 · The incident.** Click the top card on the **Incident board**.
*"Watchpost correlates alerts that share an IP, account, or host within a window. This one incident holds the whole
chain. The stages run in kill-chain order, and because it spans three or more tactics, severity is escalated."*
Scroll the alert timeline. Open one alert and show **Why this fired**, the evidence events, and the related-events
timeline. *"Every alert explains itself and shows its evidence. No black box."*

**1:25–1:40 · Report.** Back on the incident, click **Report (PDF)**.
*"One click gives a handoff report: summary, timeline, entities, techniques by tactic, and recommended actions per
technique. The PDF writer is hand-rolled too."*

**1:40–1:55 · Roles and safety.** Switch to the **viewer** window and reload.
*"This is what the public demo login sees. It's read-only. Viewers can explore incidents and download reports, but
the server refuses every change, and login is rate limited."* Show that there is no Admin item and no
Resolve button.

**1:55–2:00 · Close.**
*"Standard library only, about 200 tests plus an end-to-end smoke check, deployed behind HTTPS with systemd. It's a
portfolio project: synthetic data, no machine learning, single node. Code and demo link are in the post."*

## If something goes wrong on camera

- **No alerts appear:** check **Health**. If detection shows `failing`, the events are still stored; fix the cause and
  click **Run detection (full scan)**.
- **The live badge shows POLLING 3s instead of LIVE · SSE:** the SSE stream dropped and the page fell back to polling every
  3 seconds. It still updates. Behind nginx, check that `/api/stream` has `proxy_buffering off`.
- **The storyline card is missing:** you're not signed in as admin (viewers and analysts can't start it). **Admin → Load
  synthetic demo data** is a fallback that loads the same kinds of scenarios at once.
- **Start storyline answers 409:** a run is already in progress (possibly the `SIEM_DEMO_LOOP` timer). Click **Stop**,
  then start again.
